## Project Overview

In this project, we will be creating a comprehensive website that requires a deep understanding of various Python structures to accomplish. The website will be a clone of Netflix, a popular streaming platform.

To successfully complete this project, we will leverage accumulated knowledge from several modules and integrate new concepts introduced throughout the project.

It's crucial to have a solid foundation in Python before embarking on this endeavor. This foundation includes:

- All modules up to "Functions Used as Parameters and Lambda Expressions," which forms the "general base of Python."
- Module "Complete Object-Oriented Programming - Classes and Methods."
- Module "Python Integration with APIs and JSON."

Without this foundational knowledge, you might encounter difficulties in comprehending certain aspects of this project.

Assuming you have already completed the mentioned prerequisites, you can dive into this module with confidence. Each step will be meticulously explained in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Highlights

- Learn how to create a website from scratch using Django.
- Explore various Python concepts, including object-oriented programming and working with APIs and JSON.
- Understand the intricacies of integrating different components to build a complex application.
- Gain hands-on experience by following step-by-step instructions.

## Getting Started
